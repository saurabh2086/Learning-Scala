*1) Create a list of the first 20 odd Long numbers. Can you create this with a for-loop, with the filter operation, and with the map operation? Whatâ€™s the most efficient and expressive way to write this?*

**Answer**
*With a for loop*
```javascript
scala> for( i <- 1 to 20; if i % 2 > 0) yield i                                 
res2: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
 15, 17, 19)
```
*with a filter operation*
```javascript
scala> (1 to 20).filter(_ % 2 > 0).toList                                       
res11: List[Int] = List(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)                      
```
*with a map operation*
```javascript
scala> (0 to 9).map( _ * 2 + 1).toList                                          
res13: List[Int] = List(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)                      
```
