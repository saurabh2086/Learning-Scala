# Learning-Scala

i am new to programming languages and object oriented programming.

These are Solutions for the book learning scala

I have taken help from the  ["swartzrock/LearningScalaMaterials"]

Not all the solutions are my own
 I might revist the concepts inthe future and try to elaborate the answers more.
