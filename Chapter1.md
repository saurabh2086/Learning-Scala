*1) Although `println()` is a good way to print a string, can you find a way to print a string without `println`? 
Also, what kind of numbers, strings and other data does the REPL support?*

####Answer
An alternate way is to use `print()` method which prints without the introduction of new line 
```javascript
scala> println("goes to a new line")                                            
goes to a new line                                                              
                                                                                
scala> print("stay at the same line")                                           
stay at the same line 
```
